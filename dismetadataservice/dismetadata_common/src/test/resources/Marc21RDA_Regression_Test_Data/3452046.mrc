The problem addressed was the perception of e-mail communication effectiveness and productivity, using different e-mail processing strategies and a comparison of whether the number of e-mails received and sent differed by time increment. The experimental design quantitative research project compared perceptions of e-mail communication effectiveness and e-mail productivity using different e-mail processing strategies (the way users process new e-mail alerts), between experiment groups using a cross-sectional study posttest only design, conducted once. A test-retest pilot study was conducted prior to the experiment. The study population included 335 employees from one company. Experiment groups were formed using random assignment. Group A was instructed to process one e-mail message at a time and ignore the new message alert. Group B was instructed to multitask across e-mail messages. After the experiment, participants completed an online questionnaire. The usable experiment data included 136 participants (group A = 71; group B = 65). A post hoc power analysis revealed a power of .999. Using  t-tests the null hypothesis was rejected that no difference existed in the mean e-mail communication effectiveness rating (research question 1), and e-mail productivity rating (research question 2) between group A and group B (p < .0001 for Q1; p < .0001 for Q2), with higher means for group A for both research questions. Chi-square testing failed to reject the null hypothesis that no difference existed in the mean number of e-mails received (research question 3), and sent (research question 4), by time increment (chi2 = 0.015, p = .992 for Q3; chi2 = 0.576, p = .750 for Q4). The implication of findings and recommendation is that employees increase e-mail communication effectiveness and increase e-mail productivity by minimizing e-mail multitasking, without a significant change in the number of e-mails received or sent. Future research is recommended to investigate multiple companies and locations, managers versus non-managers, measure outcomes instead of relying on participant self-reporting, and include other communication channels.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 1443 4aManagement. 4aCommunication.  a0454  a04592 aNorthcentral University.edegree granting institution.1 aMichael Millstoneedegree supervisor.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-06A.  a1443  aPh.D.  a201140uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:3452046
