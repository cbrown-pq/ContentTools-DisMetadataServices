Defense economy is closely bound up with national economy and world economy. So, it is inevitably exposed to the impact of economic globalization, and a significant change has happened to defense economy. Economic construction and development of main developed countries displays the current characteristic of economic globalization:  (1) On the respect of strategic transition of defense economy, it has been changed into a kind of long-termed stable construction from the emergent construction in front of war, so as to deal with the transformation from all-round armament race to the competition of overall national power. Then, it has given an impetus to the development and transformation in every specific fields of defense economy. (2) On the respect of the coordination development between defense economy and national economy, army-civilian compatibility is taken to integrate defense economy with national economy in the basic formation. Market competition mechanism is introduced to increase the efficacy of defense economy and reformation on collectivize and general adoption of the market principle is taken in operation system. New and high technologies, especially the foundation and platforms of information technology, are developed to make the industrial mechanism optimized and upgraded. (3) On the respect of international cooperation of defense economy, it is encouraged to research and develop weapon systems and increase the ability of international cooperation from the traditional single-country developing method .
