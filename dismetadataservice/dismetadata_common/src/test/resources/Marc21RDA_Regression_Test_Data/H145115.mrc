Then, it has given an impetus to the development and transformation in every specific fields of defense economy. (2) On the respect of the coordination development between defense economy and national economy, army-civilian compatibility is taken to integrate defense economy with national economy in the basic formation. Market competition mechanism is introduced to increase the efficacy of defense economy and reformation on collectivize and general adoption of the market principle is taken in operation system. New and high technologies, especially the foundation and platforms of information technology, are developed to make the industrial mechanism optimized and upgraded.
