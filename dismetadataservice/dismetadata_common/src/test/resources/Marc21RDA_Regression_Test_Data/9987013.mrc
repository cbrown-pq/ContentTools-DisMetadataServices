The obtained results reflected a consistent impairment, for the AD group, in various arithmetically-based tasks such as the Wide Range Achievement Test - Revised (WRAT-R), serial sevens of the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), counting currency, making change for a purchase, and balancing a checkbook.  aThe primary measure of acalculia was performance on the WRAT-R. A Group by gender interaction was found for the WRAT-R indicating that normal elderly males tended to evidence higher scores than their female counterparts. In contrast, there were no gender differences among AD patients. Statistical significance between normal and mildly impaired AD groups were obtained even after controlling for global cognitive impairment as measured by the MMSE or overall memory impairment as assessed by the Fuld Object Memory Evaluation.  aThis indicates that acalculia may be a distinguishing feature of AD even when controlling for overall cognitive impairment and memory, which is the hallmark feature of the disorder.  aAn analysis of the types of errors made by mildly impaired AD patients indicated that they performed significantly worse than normal controls on arithmetic problems that involved simple over learned operations, single-step arithmetic operations, multi-step arithmetic operations and higher order mathematics skills such as fractions and percentages. However, multi-step operations tended to be most problematic for AD patients and accounted for the most explained variability in separating AD patients from normal elderly controls. Further, quantitative analysis of the over learned items missed further support current neuropsychological studies which suggest that there may be a dissociation between arithmetic fact retrieval and the execution of procedures. In general, the results of this study clearly indicates that calculation difficulties are common in the early stages of AD and, therefore, acalculia should be an important consideration in the diagnosis of the disorder.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 1355. 4aPsychology, Clinical. 4aGerontology. 4aBiology, Neuroscience.  a0622  a0351  a03172 aCarlos Albizu University.edegree granting institution.1 aDavid Loewensteinedegree supervisor.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg61-09B.  a1355  aPh.D.  a200040uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:9987013
