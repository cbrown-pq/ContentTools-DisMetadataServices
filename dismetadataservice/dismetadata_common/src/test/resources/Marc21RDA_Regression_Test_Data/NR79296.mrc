At the dawn of the XXIst century, having as a sure guide the theological contents of Vatican Council II, the Polish Pope held up for all to see an original pastoral vision marked by the expression "new evangelization". Borrowed from the Latin American Bishops this expression became his emblem and spearhead during nearly 27 years of pontificate. Since it has been largely appropriated by various ecclesial groups, a systematic study of the expression, in the light of the pastoral theology of its privileged discloser, had to be initiated. To do so we chose, as founding text of our study, the Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente, published in 1994, due to its pastoral vision at the dawn of the year 2000. This text, covering the period of the Vatican Council II up to the entry of the Roman Catholic Church in the Third Millennium, defined the temporal framework of our research and permitted us to retain three theological tenets. We analyzed them and produced a theological synthesis through three synoptic views which gradually led the thesis to its conclusion. The Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi  of Pope Paul VI was the starting point; the second theological tenet was the document of John Paul II entitled Sources of Renewal, and the final tenet was the Post Synodal Exhortation Ecclesia in America . By the analysis and the synthesis of these three tenets, with a justified hermeneutical initiative, three outcomes emerged. The first one looked at the pastoral application of the Vatican Council II: in a pastoral outlook justified by a defined anthropology, the minister articulated the Constitutions Lumen Gentium and Gaudium et Spes to suggest a pastoral praxis. The second outcome then developed the notion of the creativity of the faith. This creativity of the faith declined itself in the cultural mediations -- third outcome -- which articulate themselves around the concepts of attitudes and Wojtylien dialogue. The proposed critical conclusion of the thesis directly concerned the anthropology proposed by John Paul II underlying in each of these three outcomes.  aKEY WORDS New Evangelization; John Paul II; Karol Wojtyla; Pastoral Theology; Evangelii Nuntiandi; Vatican Council II; Jubilee of the Year 2000; Christology; Ecclesiology; Hermeneutics; Dialogue..  aFrench  aSchool code: 0992 4aTheology.  a04692 aUniversite de Montreal (Canada).bFaculte de theologie et de sciences des religions.edegree granting institution.1 aJean-Francois Rousseledegree supervisor.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-07A(E).  a0992  aPh.D.  a201240uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR79296
