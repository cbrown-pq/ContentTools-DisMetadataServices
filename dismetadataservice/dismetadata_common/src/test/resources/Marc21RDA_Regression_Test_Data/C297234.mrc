These specifications do not only consist of a logical description, but also of performance demands. An elegant way to meet these specifications is to use performance-driven circuit-generation techniques. This thesis describes a cell compiler which introduces these techniques in the CMOS sea-of-gates environment, allowing to tune the performance of cells according to their demands. This offers an increased flexibility in layout and leads to better performance results.  aThe performance-driven micro-cell compiler can be divided into the following three blocks. (1) Performance evaluator. (2) Topology generator. (3) Layout generator.  aThe performance evaluator is a tool which is able to compute the performance parameters of a micro-cell in a fast and accurate way. These parameters are the propagation delay, output rise/fall-time, power dissipation, upper and lower noise margins and area. The performance evaluator is used by the topology generator to guide the performance optimization process.  aThe topology generator is responsible for determining the topology of a micro-cell that fits the goal constraints best. The topology generator is able to deal with bounded and unbounded constraints. Using both constraints in a single micro-cell run leads to a bounded optimization, or constrained optimization. The output of the topology generator consists of the optimized topology of a micro-cell.  aThe layout generator uses this optimized topology, in combination with a description of the sea-of-gates array, to generate a description of the interconnect layers. It is able to deal with any row-oriented sea-of-gates array, with oxide and/or transistor isolation and with two or more metal interconnect layers. The layout generator offers also flexibility in the aspect ratio of the generated layout. The generated layout description is used to process the circuit.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 0237 4aEngineering, Electronics and Electrical.  a05442 aUniversiteit Twente (The Netherlands).edegree granting institution.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg54-03C.  a0237  aDr.  a199340uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:C297234
