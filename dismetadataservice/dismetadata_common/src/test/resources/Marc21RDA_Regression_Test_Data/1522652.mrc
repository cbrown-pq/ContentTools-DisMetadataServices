It was hoped that information given helped female Hispanics to be more knowledgeable about healthy eating habits and utilize this knowledge in their every day practice as they attempt to control their glucose levels and thus help them prevent complications from this disease. Diabetes education and inclusion of cultural foods, is a key in controlling diabetes and preventing diabetes complication. The key concepts of education with Latinos: educating the main person that cooks for the family, educating females to make changes in the overall diet not only of the diabetic person, but also of the whole family. According to Whittemore, with a nutritional education, Hispanic populations had increased their ability to control their blood sugar levels as well as decreased the number of complications being caused by the disease.  aA voluntary sample of eleven community members who had diabetes or a family member with diabetes, were recruited at a community church in Long Beach to attend a diabetes lecture. A pretest was given, followed by and educational session on basics of diabetes and techniques in implementing cultural foods into their diabetic diet. Then a posttest was administered.  aThere were significant gaps between basic diabetes knowledge and integration of cultural foods into the diabetic diet. These results indicated a need for future projects to integrate education on cultural foods, so individuals with diabetes can still enjoy cultural foods while achieving glycemic controls.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 6080 4aHealth Sciences, Nursing.  a05692 aCalifornia State University, Long Beach.bNursing.edegree granting institution.2 aCalifornia State University, Long Beach.bPublic Health.edegree granting institution.1 aSavitri Singh-Carlsonedegree supervisor.0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-05(E).  a6080  aM.S.N.  a201340uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1522652
