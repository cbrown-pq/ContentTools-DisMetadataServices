Studies on locus of control show that those with an internal locus of control are more successful as well.  Homelessness is an issue that affects a significant number of individuals and families.  This study explored the relationship between resilience and locus of control among 70 homeless and non-homeless adults in Fairbanks, Alaska using Wagnild's Resilience Scale and Rotter's I-E Locus of Control Scale. Three hypotheses were explored.  First, homeless adults were predicted to have lower resilience than non-homeless adults; secondly, a correlation was predicted between higher resilience and an internal locus of control and thirdly, the relationship between resilience and locus of control would be affected by housing status. This study found that homeless adults did have lower resilience than non-homeless adults.  However, the results of this study showed no statistical relationship between an internal locus of control and higher resilience, regardless of housing status.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 1351 4aIndividual & family studies. 4aSocial research. 4aSociology, Public and Social Welfare.  a0628  a0344  a06302 aCapella University.bSchool of Public Service Leadership.edegree granting institution.1 aEdward J.
