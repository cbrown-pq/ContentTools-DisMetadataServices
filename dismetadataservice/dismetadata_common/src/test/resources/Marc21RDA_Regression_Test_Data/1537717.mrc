As a point of departure, I reflect upon the composers, sound artists and thinkers that I consider fundamental to the development of this field and to my own concepts. I then embark on a detailed description of each of the pieces that I developed during the last two years, starting from a description of the sounds in the field recordings and then explaining the process of translation, which consists of transcription, notation, orchestration, and the conceptualization of form. I conclude with a reflection on the poetics of this process---the aesthetic meaning and the artistic results of the translation of soundscapes into musical composition.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 1069 4aMusic.  a04132 aMills College.bMusic.edegree granting institution.1 aZeena Parkinsedegree supervisor.1 aFred Frithedegree supervisor.0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-06(E).  a1069  aM.A.  a201340uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1537717
