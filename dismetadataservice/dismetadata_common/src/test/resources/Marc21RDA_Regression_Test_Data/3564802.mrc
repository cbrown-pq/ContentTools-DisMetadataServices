The two hour long composition requires 44 performers to stage: 14 singers, 8 dancers, and a conducted 21 piece orchestra. In addition to traditional acoustic instruments (winds, brass, percussion, strings) the orchestra includes electric guitars, drum set, and audio and video laptop performers. How We Saved the World is situated in a future time and begins with the premise that the world has been "saved." Human beings have found a way to live in peace and harmony with one another and with the ecology of our planet Earth. We, the participants in the performance are sharing among ourselves the story of how human culture changed from the destructive, unsustainable practices and consciousness of the past. The libretto is included as an appendix. The score and all of the audio files needed to perform the piece are included as supplementary material.  aEnglish  aSchool code: 0225. 4aMusic. 4aTheater. 4aDance. 4aMultimedia Communications.  a0413  a0465  a0378  a05582 aTemple University.bMusic Composition.edegree granting institution.1 aMaurice Wrightedegree supervisor.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-10A(E).  a0225  aD.M.A.  a201340uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:3564802
