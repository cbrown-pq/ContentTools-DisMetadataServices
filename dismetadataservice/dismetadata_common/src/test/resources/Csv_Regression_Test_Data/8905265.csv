This study utilized a sample of 176 degree-seeking students enrolled in master's- and doctoral-level education programs at Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas, during the Spring of 1988. The Adult Career Concerns Inventory was administered to measure the students' overall levels of concerns and their concerns in the Exploration, Establishment, Maintenance, and Disengagement Stages of career development. A one-way analysis of variance was applied to test 7 major hypotheses and 28 sub-hypotheses at the.05 level of significance.<p>    Significant findings revealed the following: (1) When age was considered, graduate students 51 years old and above had higher overall levels of career development concerns than students in the other age groups, as well as higher levels of concerns in the Disengagement Stage. (2) When female master's- and doctoral-level students were compared, the master's-level females exhibited higher overall levels of career development concerns in addition to higher levels of concerns in each of the four career development stages. (3) When male and female master's- level students were compared, the female students showed higher levels of concerns in the Disengagement Stage.<p>    Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that age, when considered apart from other variables, is an important determinant of graduate students' levels of career development concerns, particularly with respect to preparation for disengagement from the world of work. It was also concluded that enrollment in the master's-level program is an important determinant of the career development concerns at all stages for female students when compared with their doctoral-level female counterparts. When these same students are compared with their master's-level male counterparts, career development concerns in the Disengagement Stage become paramount. <p>","Education, Guidance and Counseling|Education, Adult and Continuing|Education, General","0519|0516|0515","Education|Education|Education","N",,,,,"A|CAREER|COMPARISON|CONCERNS|DEVELOPMENT|GRADUATE|LEVELS|STUDENTS","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix","5|8","Do not sell third party vendor|Do not sell third party Indexing","21-NOV-2012|21-NOV-2012","NONE|NONE","DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","A","N","19-JUL-2014",,,,,,,,"UNITED STATES","P","Paper",
