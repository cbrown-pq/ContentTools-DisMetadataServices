Patient awareness of MURs was poor and nearly all MURs were initiated by the pharmacist; no patients were referred from the GP. Pharmacy staff did not actively seek to recruit patients who may benefit most from an <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> and the majority were invited in ad hoc manner. Patients were given little time to consider whether to take part in an <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> and were insufficiently informed of their purpose or personal value. MURs were framed as a monitoring activity and most patients reported that the <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> did little to improve their knowledge of their medicines and rarely affected their use. They perceived their GP to have the main authority over their medicines. Patients considered that significant medicine-related problems would be best resolved by talking to the GP rather than with the pharmacist during an <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place>. In effect, a supplier induced demand for MURs was observed. Nevertheless, all patients reported feeling comfortable speaking to the pharmacist during an <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> and most described the consultation in positive terms. Most patients viewed the pharmacist as a knowledgeable expert and some felt reassured about their medicines following an <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span><p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Observations of the MUR consultation revealed pharmacists were subordinate to the â€˜technologyâ€™ of the <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> form and adhered to its â€˜tick-boxâ€™ format. Pharmacists used predominantly closed questions which enabled the <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> form to be completed efficiently, but this forestalled wider discussion of the patientâ€™s health and medicines. The <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place> service was at odds with the intention to create a patient-centred service. When complex or indeterminate issues were raised, these were often circumvented or the patient referred to the GP. Pharmacists reported in their interviews that they welcomed MURs and the resultant potential to raise their profile with patients. They also reported concerns over patient recruitment, organisational pressures to pursue a target number of MURs and difficulties integrating MURs within their existing activities. MURs were pragmatically accommodated alongside existing duties without additional resource. Support staff reported feeling discomfort when they were left to explain to patients and customers why the pharmacist was absent during an <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span><p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This study highlights the need for consultation and communication skills training for pharmacists, so they are able to effectively elicit patient beliefs, concerns and preferences about medicines during the <st1:place w:st="on">MUR</st1:place>. Organisations also need to reconsider the way they motivate pharmacists to undertake MURs to avoid unintended consequences for patient care. Policy makers should reconsider strategies that are based on rationalised policies as a means to improving patient adherence to medicines. Effective services need to be responsive to the patientâ€™s individual circumstance and preference.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>","Health Sciences, Public Health","0573","Health and Environmental Sciences","N",,,,,"A|CASE|COMMUNITY|MEDICINES|MURS|PHARMACIES|REVIEWS|STUDY|TWO|USE","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix",,,,,"DAC","Dissertation Abstracts International",,"N",,,
