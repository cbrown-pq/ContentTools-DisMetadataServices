Content knowledge and content pedagogical knowledge are in fact important components of the knowledge base in teaching (Shulman, 1986a). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of content knowledge and content pedagogical knowledge on the use of general pedagogical skills for the beginning teacher. Subjects of the study were 16 physical education preservice teachers in their junior year. Subjects taught a total six lessons, two lessons in three different content areas. A variety of instruments were used to assess content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and general pedagogical skills.<p>    The results of the study seem to suggest that pedagogical content knowledge and knowledge of the content itself does impact the use of general pedagogical skills of the beginning teacher. Most general pedagogical skills were significantly effected by the content taught. The dance lessons encouraged a different set of teaching behaviors characterized by command teaching which caused increased instruction time, increased use of extension and repeating tasks, a lower rate of feedback and the use of walk through demonstrations and summary cues, particularly during activity time. The manipulative skills were characterized by the use of a direct instruction approach with independent practice which caused an increase in activity time, an increased use of application tasks and the use of full demonstrations and summary cues before independent practice. The preservice teachers appropriately selected these profiles of general pedagogical skills. A lower level of activity time, clarity and accuracy of task presentation, specific feedback, refining tasks, qualitative information, full demonstration and summary cues and structuring and reinforcing behavior would seem to indicate that content knowledge itself also played an important role in the effectiveness of the teacher. The use of activity time, the clarity and accuracy of task presentation, the use of refining tasks and the use of summary cues were lower in the dance lessons which should not have been effected by the nature of the content itself. <p>","Education, Teacher Training|Education, Physical","0530|0523","Education|Education","N",,,,,"CONTENT|EDUCATION|INSTRUCTIONAL|KNOWLEDGE|PERFORMANCE|PHYSICAL|RELATION","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix","5|8","Do not sell third party vendor|Do not sell third party Indexing","21-NOV-2012|21-NOV-2012","NONE|NONE","DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","A","N","01-APR-2015",,,,,,,,"UNITED STATES","P","Paper","United States","United States","N",
