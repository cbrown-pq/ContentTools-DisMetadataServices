This biofilm electrode (BFE) system includes an electrochemical sensor and a biofilm of microorganisms. Measurement is based on instantaneous detection of changes in oxygen respiratory activity of biofilm upon exposure to toxic chemicals. The BFE response represents integrative effect of all chemicals present in the sample, which includes both synergistic and antagonistic effects. The BFE current readout was used to calculate respiratory control ratio (RCR) values, which are the ratios of respiration rates in the test and control runs.<p>    The objective of this study was to optimize design and operational characteristics of the BFE system. The research approach was based on studying two main biosensor configurations. The first configuration has a suspension of microorganisms (yeast cells) open to the atmosphere. Changes in the respiratory activity of the yeast cells upon contact with toxic chemicals were monitored by in situ dissolved oxygen measurement using an amperometric oxygen membrane electrode. The second configuration has a biofilm of immobilized yeast cells in contact with an amperometric oxygen membrane electrode. Changes in oxygen respiration rates of the biofilm upon contact with toxic chemicals were monitored.<p>    Mathematical models for oxygen diffusion current and biosensor response were developed for these two biosensor configurations, and can be used to optimize designs for BFE systems for particular applications. Performance characteristics of both systems were determined, including sensitivity, detection limits, and response time. Two types of toxic chemicals were tested, a respiratory inhibitor (potassium cyanide), and a respiratory uncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol = 2,4-DNP).<p>    Experimental results were used to validate the mathematical models. Detection limits for open suspension biosensor ranged from 0.2-0.4 mg/l and sensitivity was on the order of 10$\sp{-11}$ mg $O\sb2$/(sec.cell.mg chemical) for KCN. This biosensor was ineffective in sensing the respiratory uncoupling effect of 2,4-DNP.<p>    BFE biosensor limits of detection ranged from 0.05-0.2 mg/l for KCN and 10-20 mg/l for 2,4-DNP. Sensitivity was on the order of 10$\sp{-8}$ mg $O\sb2$/(sec.cell.mg chemical) for KCN and 10$\sp{-10}$ mg $O\sb2$/(sec.cell.mg chemical) for 2,4-DNP. <p>","Engineering, Biomedical|Engineering, Chemical","0541|0542","Applied Sciences|Applied Sciences","N",,,,,"BIOFILM|CHARACTERIZATION|CHEMICALS|ELECTRODE|SCREENING|SYSTEM|TOXIC","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix","5|8","Do not sell third party vendor|Do not sell third party Indexing","21-NOV-2012|21-NOV-2012","NONE|NONE","DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","B","N",,,,,,,"UNITED STATES",
