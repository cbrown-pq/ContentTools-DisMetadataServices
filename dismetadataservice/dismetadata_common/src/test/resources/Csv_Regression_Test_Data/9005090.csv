Subjects were also classified into one of three adult styles of attachment: secure, avoidant and anxious/ambivalent. Seven predictions were made related to subjects appraisals of current relationships, the association between loneliness and attachment style, the association between attachment style and parent-child relationships, and the association between loneliness and early parent-child relationships. Support for all hypotheses was found. Lonely women tended to perceive their friendships more negatively than non-lonely women, even though their friends did not share the same perception. Loneliness was found to be more prevalent in women with anxious/ambivalent and avoidant styles of attachment. Securely attached subjects reported consistently positive descriptions of their parents and family relationships. Avoidant subjects reported consistently negative perceptions of their parents and family relationships. Anxious/Ambivalent women described their parents and families in both positive and negative terms. Lonely subjects were found to describe their parents and families more like the insecure attachment styles and non-lonely subjects described their family relationships more like the secure women. Lonely women also tended to describe their friendships in a similiar manner to the way they had described their relationship with their parents. Attachment theory is discussed as a way of explaining the results. <p>","Education, Educational Psychology|Sociology, Individual and Family Studies","0525|0628","Education|Social Sciences","N",,,,,"ATTACHMENT|DIFFERENCES|FAMILY|FRIENDSHIPS|LONELY|NON|PERCEPTIONS|RELATIONSHIPS|WOMEN","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix","5|8","Do not sell third party vendor|Do not sell third party Indexing","21-NOV-2012|21-NOV-2012","NONE|NONE","DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","A","N",,,,,,,,"UNITED STATES","P","Paper",
