In the lyric genre, the sonnet is a rigorously closed fragment of a larger whole. As a meditation on love, it stands complete within itself, but as part of a larger collection each sonnet belongs to the context in which it is found. By standing back from the individual sonnet and seeing it in relation to its context and then to the sequence as a whole one is able to see that narrative forces of closure are constantly challenged by forces denying closure. As an epic, The Faerie Queene lends itself to a discussion of problems of closure because it is the major unfinished work in the English Renaissance. Until recently, critics focused on its possible resolution, arguing that Spenser's intentions were to construct a coherent form whose end would have occurred only in Book XII. Paralleling the shift in critical theory in the mid-1960s, readers began to focus on how the narrative forces moving toward resolution were constantly challenged and eventually undermined by forces denying resolution. But resolution occurs in each of the six books, and in Book VI especially Spenser constructs an image in the dance of the Graces in which both the private and public virtues are consolidated. Yet final resolution is deferred until a time beyond the text when the reader is able to fashion the gentle discipline of courtesy, the source of all virtue, portrayed by that dance. By instructing the reader in the laws of courtesy, Spenser aligns himself with Sidney's vision in ""The Defence of Poetry,"" that poetry should construct images of virtue, the order and coherence of which reflect a secular image of the sacred community from which mankind fell. In his epic poem Spenser furthers the cause of Renaissance humanism when he expands the exploration of limited private relationships in the sonnet sequences to analyze on a more public and universal level the conflict of resolution and its deferral that momentarily occurs between desire and virtue and that can assist in the construction of a civilized human community. <p>","Literature, English","0593","Language, Literature and Linguistics","N",,,,,"CLOSURE|ENGLISH|LITERARY|PROBLEMS|RENAISSANCE","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix","5|8","Do not sell third party vendor|Do not sell third party Indexing","21-NOV-2012|21-NOV-2012","NONE|NONE","DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","A","N","01-APR-2015","XMC","Only Microfiche and Electronic available","2002-03-15 00:20:51","NONE",,,,"NONE","XX","No Manuscript - PAO","Canada","NONE","N",
