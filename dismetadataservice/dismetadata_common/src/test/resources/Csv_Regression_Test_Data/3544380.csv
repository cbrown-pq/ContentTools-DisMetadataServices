People like Gandhi, Albert Schweitzer, and Mother Teresa are seen as the paradigm moral saints. However, there is a widespread assumption that due to their radical altruism, moral saints are not flourishing. So some critics think that moral sainthood is unworthy of recommendation. By contrast, I argue that attaining moral sainthood is binding and, through critically engaging relevant empirical studies, I conclude that moral saints are flourishing. However, the whole argument is premised upon the fact that moral sainthood is primarily a religious phenomenon.<p>","Philosophy|Ethics|Religion, Philosophy of","0422|0394|0322","Philosophy, Religion and Theology|Philosophy, Religion and Theology|Philosophy, Religion and Theology","N",,,,"Philosophy","A|EUDAIMONIA|Eudaimonia|JUSTIFICATION|MORAL|MORAL ARGUMENT|MORAL SAINTS|Moral argument|Moral saints|NEW NATURAL LAW THEORY|New natural law theory|PHILOSOPHICAL|SAINTHOOD|SAINTS|Sainthood|VIRTUE ETHICS|Virtue ethics","For Datrix|For Datrix|By I and L|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|By Author|By Author|For Datrix|By Author|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|By I and L|For Datrix|By Author","5","Do not sell third party vendor","23-OCT-2012",,"DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","A","Y","07-DEC-2012",,
