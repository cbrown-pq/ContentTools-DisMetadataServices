Three creative areas were selected for observation during the period from 600 to 1250 A.D.; literature, theriophoric personal names, and art historical evidence were considered in the measure in which they were preserved. The evidence from Old High German, Old English and Old Icelandic periods was combined to yield a rough synchronic view of the older period, admittedly already showing signs of Christian varnish, and this stage of the older material was then contrasted with the Middle High German evidence to produce a diachronic analysis of the effects of the acculturative process on the Germanic system of man-animal relationship under the growing influence of the Christian system of reference. Major observations include the decline of references involving animals having negative connotations in Christian contexts, e.g., wolf, boar and bear, and the predominance of the lion in literary and artistic contexts. The advent of the courtly period marks the beginning of an intensification of certain man-animal relationships best exemplified by Iwein and his lion. The area of personal names proved impervious to intrusion, destructive or creative. Other animal figures common and acceptable to both cultures, e.g., eagle and horse, remain in stable distribution for the period.<p>    Each area discussed is worthy of a dissertation in itself; this general overview of the relational system and acculturative changes provides a framework for detailed studies of single aspects. In addition to tracing the effects of the acculturative process, this dissertation established an outline of man-animal reference in the Germanic context without forced reference to mythology. The picture which emerges from this analysis is not as detailed as the one derived by reference to mythology; however, the imposition of mythological reference has been demonstrated to produce gross misinterpretation, and the picture presented here is assuredly more reflective of the status of man-animal reference in the Middle Ages. <p>","Literature, Germanic|Anthropology, Cultural|History, Medieval","0311|0326|0581","Language, Literature and Linguistics|Social Sciences|Social Sciences","N",,,,,"ACCULTURATION|AGES|ANIMAL|GERMANIC|MAN|MEDIEVAL|MIDDLE|RELATIONSHIP","For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix|For Datrix","5|8","Do not sell third party vendor|Do not sell third party Indexing","21-NOV-2012|21-NOV-2012","NONE|NONE","DAI","Dissertation Abstracts International","A","Y","26-MAR-2010",,,,"UNITED STATES",
