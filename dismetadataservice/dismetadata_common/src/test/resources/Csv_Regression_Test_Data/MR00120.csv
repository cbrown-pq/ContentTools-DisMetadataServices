This reform began in 1989 with a General Assembly Resolution, submitted by Trinidad and Tobago, to establish an International Criminal Court. In June/July, 1998, a Plenipotentiary Conference was held in Rome to decide whether or not to proceed with the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC). <p>   Chapter One provides a brief analysis of some United Nations targets for reform and some proposals as to reform initiatives. Chapter Two provides a clear historical analysis of the reform initiative to establish an ICC. This chapter also provides a brief explanation of some of the practical aspects of the proposed Court. Chapter Three examines five supposed benefits which proponents of this reform initiative have given for support of this United Nations reform initiative. Chapter Four examines three potential obstacles to the establishment of an International Criminal Court. Chapter Five, as a concluding chapter, analyzes both the supposed benefits and potential obstacles to the establishment of an International Criminal Court in order to establish whether or not this reform initiative is a practical one.
