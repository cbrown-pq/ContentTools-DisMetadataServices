It was a problem-based learning project focused on the teacher quality standards adopted by the Missouri State Board of Education in June 2011. In the earliest stages prior to adoption of the standards, the researchers hired by the state indicated the problem with evaluating all nine standards and 36 indicators. As there was no system to determine what the most important standards were, the project sought to provide a system of weight to assist with the implementation of the standards.  aAs the background information indicated, the standards were research-based and provided an excellent framework for quality teaching. This project utilized perceptual data from Missouri principals and superintendents. These principals represented the highest and lowest achieving schools in the state based on the criteria for accreditation. A discrepancy analysis was completed to ascertain the importance of each standard.  aAt the conclusion of the project with all survey data analyzed, the solution was to weight the standards based on three things. First, the highest weight standards were based on the highest-achieving schools' responses. Second, the lowest standards were identified by both groups as the lowest. Finally, the five standards between were labeled as being within the purview of local discretion, but between the highest and lowest weighted standards. This system of weight was rooted in the survey responses and ensures local districts find value in the use of the standards as evaluative criteria.  aSchool code: 0193. 4aEducation, Evaluation. 4aEducation, Policy. 4aEducation, Leadership.  a0443  a0458  a044910aLong, Jacob E.ejoint author10aSmith, Scott A.ejoint author20aSaint Louis University.bEducational Leadership.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-11A(E).  a0193  aEd.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:3587237
