Purpose: In order to obtain sufficient porcelain-titanium bond, it is important to investigate the bonding mechanism and the properties of chemical reactions in the porcelain-titanium interface. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of porcelain composition, different surface conditioning methods, multiple firings and interface reactions between porcelain and titanium on the porcelain-titanium bonding strength. The results were compared with those of the Vita Titankeramik. Material and methods: Shear specimens consisting of porcelain cylinders 9mm in diameter and 4mm in length were fired to the peripheral surface of cylinders of pure titanium 3mm in diameter and 3Omm in length. Specimens were tested in push type shear in a universal testing machine. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were employed to relate the microstructures and diffusion of elements in the interfacial regions between the porcelain coating and titanium to the bond strength when fired at 800 degC. The study were in four parts. The l~(st) part concerned the influences of different ratios of crystallized compositions in the porcelain on the shear bond strength; The 2~(nd) part investigated the effects of different surface conditioning methods(couple agent coating, pre-oxidation treatment. sand blasting of fusing surface of titanium) on the shear bond strength; The 3~(rd) part analyzed the effects of multiple firings on the shear bond strength; The 4~(th) part carried out some pilot study on the interface reactions between titanium and porcelain during firing. Results: Ratios of crystallized compositions have significant infiuences on porcelain-titanium bond strength (P<O.O5). La_(2258) had the highest shear bond strength (37.76MPa) when the ratio of crystallized composition was 0.44-0.46.When a couple agent was used, porcelain to titanium bond was significantly higher for Vita Titankeramik but lower for La_(2258) (P<O.O5). The shear bond strength decreased for Vita Titankeramik (P0.05) after firing of the porcelain to the pre-oxidated titanium surface. Bond strength for La_(2258) was not statistically different (P>O.O5)after sand blasting the titanium surface with Al_2O_3 in the particle sizes ranged from 8O to 25O um. The bond strength decreased significantly for both Vita and La_(2258) after seven firing cycles(P<0.O5). EPMA analysis demonstrated the aggregation Si and Sn in the interfacial regions and their diffusion into the titanium. The results of SEM revealed integrity of porcelain-titanium joints in La_(2258). Conclusions: l.Chemical compositions of porcelain has great influences on the titanium porcelain bond. Si and Sn played important roles in the porcelain-titanium bond. 2.The use of couple agent has inverse effects on porcelain-titanium bond for La_(2258) but positive effects for Vita Titankeramik. Couple agent fit for La_(2258) needs further development. 3.Pre-oxidation of titanium surface is unnecessary for La_(2258), and not suit for Vita Titankeramik 4. Sand blasting the titanium surface with Al_2O_3 in the particle size ranged from 80 to 250 um has no influences on porcelain-titanium bond. 5.Multiple firing leads to the increase in oxidation layer and results in decrease of porcelain-titanium bond, excessive firing cycles should be avoided in clinical practice. 6.Diffusion of Sn into the titanium substrate indicates the possibility of redox reactions in the interfacial region, Sn is important in porcelain-titanium bond.  aSchool code: 9089. 4aHealth Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.  a056420aWest China University of Medical Science (People's Republic of China).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-20C.  a9089  aM.S.  a2000  aChinese  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:H015559
