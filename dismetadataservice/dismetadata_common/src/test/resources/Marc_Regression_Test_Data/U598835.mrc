Tablets account for the majority of the pharmaceutical preparations. Its manufacturing process entails a significant number of manual steps that is generally accomplished using batch processing with off-line quality control (QC) laboratory testing conducted on collected samples post production to evaluate quality. This approach of testing quality into the product has a number of disadvantages which bears a higher risk of manufacturing products of suboptimal quality that may therefore require investigating, reworking or rejecting and thus is time consuming and costly. The objective of this dissertation is to enable a tablet manufacturer to move from a post-process quality control (QC) system to quality by design (QbD) product manufacture and real-time release. This is to be achieved by developing a process analytical technology (PAT) strategy that monitors and controls the manufacturing process real-time, utilising in-/on-/at-line vibrational spectroscopic techniques combined with chemometric methods. Vibrational spectroscopic and imaging techniques as PAT for in-line (or where not possible on-line / at-line) tablet manufacturing process (divided into unit of operations) are reviewed here. Optimal interactions between the spectroscopic / imaging techniques and the tablet manufacturing process have been identified; where tablet production process can be monitored real-time (or close to real-time). A strategy to enable QbD tablet manufacture and real-time release has been identified..  aSchool code: 0994. 4aPhysics, Optics.  a075220aUniversity of London, King's College (United Kingdom).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-27C.  a0994  aM.Sc.  a2010  aEnglish
