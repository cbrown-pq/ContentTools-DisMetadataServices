The new regime allowed the Anglicans and Roman Catholics to start their mission work in Ovamboland in 1924, but each denomination, including the Finnish Lutherans, was required to restrict its work to certain tribes. The Finnish missionaries tried to influence native kings to not allow the newcomers to settle in their tribal areas. The director of the Finnish Mission Society, Rev. Matti Tarkkanen, drew the International Missionary Council, the National Lutheran Council of America and some influential ecumenical persons into the conflict. During his inspection tour of South West Africa in 1925 Tarkkanen met the Anglican Bishop Nelson Fogarty, the administrator of SWA, and the Prime Minister of South Africa. As a result of these meetings the territorial tribal restrictions were abolished in 1926.  aThe mission activities carried out by the Anglicans were limited to the Oukwanyama tribe only. The relationship between the Anglicans and the Finns grew somewhat friendly even though the Anglicans were still considered as rivals. Because The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel advocated High Church practices, the Finns accused them of being too Roman Catholic by nature. The Intercommunion between the Church of England and the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church was established in 1934, which had a positive effect also on the missionary work in Ovamboland: the Anglican bishop at that time expressed his willingness to withdraw the Anglican mission from Ovamboland.  aThe Roman Catholics constituted a notable rival for the Finns in their work with the western tribes of Ovamboland. In Okavango, where the Finnish Mission Society extended its work in 1929, the Roman Catholics' position was fully established. The relationship between them became very tense.  aIn this denominational rivalry the Finns planned their work in such a way as to hamper other missions. The Finns tried to secure their own status by territorial expansion, strengthening their own position and by intensifying their teaching of Lutheran doctrine.  aThe native kings usually favoured the party that would give them the most economic and political benefits. The local authorities seemed to favour the Finnish Mission Society, at the expense of the other missions, as far as they were able.  aSchool code: 0592. 4aTheology. 4aHistory, Church. 4aHistory, African.  a0469  a0330  a033120aHelsingin Yliopisto (Finland).00aThe Finnish Mission's relationship to the Anglicans and Roman Catholics in South West Africa in 1919--1937.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg61-01C.  a0592  aTh.D.  a1998  aFinnish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:C800097
