While the conservation of both crop genetic and species diversity in Amazonia has become an increasing concern in recent years, the factors that influence the distribution and maintenance of plant diversity in rural communities are poorly understood. Utilizing data from surveys and ethnographic interviews at 138 rural households in the municipality of Borba, Amazonas, Brazil, this dissertation examines the primary factors that influence the diversity of plant species (i.e. species richness) managed by smallholder farmers. Multiple regression analyses demonstrate that the independent variables "age of household head," "area of land under cultivation", and "environmental habitat" (floodplain or highlands) are statistically significant determinants of species richness, accounting for 31.5% of variation in species richness among households. Ethnographic data point toward several other socio-cultural influences that shape the contemporary patterning of plant diversity, including social networks of exchange, gender roles in agricultural management, cultivation of magic plants, and the individual life histories of farmers and the lands they manage. In short, this dissertation demonstrates how history, social relationships, and cultural beliefs have important bearing on the management of agrobiodiversity in rural Amazonian communities, and thus demand consideration in any initiatives aimed at agrobiodiversity conservation.  aSchool code: 0070. 4aAnthropology, Cultural. 4aNatural Resource Management. 4aSustainability. 4aEconomics, Agricultural.  a0326  a0528  a0640  a050320aUniversity of Florida.0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-06A.10aOyuela-Caycedo, Augusto,eadvisor  a0070  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish
